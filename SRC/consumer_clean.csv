2870,"Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",even im outside bright sunlight word book im reading still crystal clear alone make kindle oasis worth cost methe kindle oasis wake second book choose instantly open ready readit perfect size isnt heavy bulky really read hour time sometimes pace floor read sometimes im elliptical machine read sometimes im sit matter im kindle oasis remains comfortable hold always easy eyeswhen receive book pdf time enlarge word wont allow enlarge word change orientation page word automatically large able make note book need highlight word andor passagesmy merlot leather cover attractive flip open like opening cover bookhow make battery laston kindle oasis page say dualbattery charge system delivers month battery life huge thing instead charge tablet almost every day would able read month without charge kindleis oasis perform well much condition met charge oasis last two monthsfirst limit reading thirty minute day one impossible day able read thirty minute dont occur often kindle go everywhere use every spare moment readsecond wireless need turn one easy always easy remember time wireless need download one booksthird base light set 10 way low keep light set anywhere 16 18i dont limit reading thirty minute day try remember keep wireless turn light set kept anywhere 16 18 put kindle sleep second im do reading long single charge last ten day long charge last far would kept charge several day remember turn wireless succeed keep wireless let know long charge lastsnow dont plug charge soon charge cover get low allow cover charge go low possibly go kindle battery start drain since longer charge cover allow drain 50 plug cover kindle computer chargethe one thing surprised everything oasis black white reason thought maybe book cover would appear color since bought oasis read book color isnt neededspecial offer appear screen kindle go sleep wake arent distraction honest kind fun look pay high price wont appear kindle would rather see themi ask question kindle knew work know bought kindle oasis charge wouldnt last month would still bought yes would know everything would appear black white would still bought yes would,5.0

6027,"Apples & oranges. They're both fruit, both tasty, but they are different at the same time.When thinking about the new $50 7"" Fire tablet, keep in mind that this is not a high-end Samsung or iPad Mini. It does a lot of the same things, but it's different. It costs a fraction of the cost. With that perspective in mind, this is a fantastic value. In fact, short of finding a nice, 2nd-tier Asus , LG, or Lenovo tablet being pushed on discount sites, probably as refurbs, you're not going to find anything that comes close in value to this new Fire tablet.Prior to getting it, I had my concerns, particularly with the screen given the lower resolution. I have a dozen tablets, and have tried about a dozen others, and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on. Amazon got this right. It is not as crisp as my older Kindle Fire HD 7"" or my Galaxy Note 8.0 or my iPad Mini, but for casual reading, gaming, video viewing, email, etc., the screen is just fine. Worlds beyond most low-end/budget tablets I've tried (especially anything costing under $100 new). My daughter, who has been using a Kindle Fire HD 7"", has not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution.The new Fire OS operating system looks & feels much more like Android or iOS, which is nice overall. It still is not perfect, but overall I think it makes for a much better user experience than the version on older Kindle Fire tablets.The 8GB of internal storage is, of course, paltry, but with the very welcome addition of a microSD slot, carrying loads of media with you for offline consumption is not an issue. What remains to be seen is how performance is impacted if/when the little bit of available internal storage gets filled with apps and other content. So far, this has not been a problem.The inclusion of both front- and rear-facing cameras is a nice bonus. No, you're not going to capture great shots. But both cameras are usable and add value.The speakers are OK. Volume and quality is not great, but is acceptable for general use - and, of course, you can also use headphones or an external speaker to kick things up a notch (or several notches).If you have $150 or more to spend on a tablet, and plan on using it quite a bit, then you can definitely find something a bit nicer. If you're getting this for just occasional use, or for a kid, and are not accustomed to using a high-end tablet, then this is a fantastic buy. I've tested over 20 tablets and for a sub-$100 tablet, this is absolutely a great value. At its current price of $50, it's a no-brainer. Kudos to Amazon for raising the bar on budget tablets AND making quality tablets available to the masses.",apple orange theyre fruit tasty different timewhen think new 50 7 fire tablet keep mind highend samsung ipad mini lot thing different cost fraction cost perspective mind fantastic value fact short find nice 2ndtier asus lg lenovo tablet push discount site probably refurbs youre go find anything come close value new fire tabletprior get concern particularly screen give low resolution dozen tablet try dozen others screen quality something want scrimp much amazon get right crisp old kindle fire hd 7 galaxy note 80 ipad mini casual reading game video view email etc screen fine world beyond lowendbudget tablet ive try especially anything cost 100 new daughter use kindle fire hd 7 care one bit slightly low screen resolutionthe new fire o operating system look feel much like android io nice overall still perfect overall think make much well user experience version old kindle fire tabletsthe 8gb internal storage course paltry welcome addition microsd slot carry load medium offline consumption issue remains see performance impact ifwhen little bit available internal storage get fill apps content far problemthe inclusion front rearfacing camera nice bonus youre go capture great shot camera usable add valuethe speaker ok volume quality great acceptable general use course also use headphone external speaker kick thing notch several notchesif 150 spend tablet plan use quite bit definitely find something bit nicer youre get occasional use kid accustom use highend tablet fantastic buy ive test 20 tablet sub100 tablet absolutely great value current price 50 nobrainer kudos amazon raise bar budget tablet make quality tablet available mass,5.0

Aside from access to a ridiculous amount of books, I can listen to music, download apps, play games, watch videos, take photos/ record videos (front & rear facing camera), check emails, and surf the web. Although you have to pay for most book/video purchases Amazon also offers Amazon Prime for a month free ($9.99 after) which makes some purchases less expensive. You can also tack on Kindle Unlimited (free 1st month, also $9.99 a month after) to download up to 10 Kindle Unlimited books at a time. As for the possible cons, the lock screen is set as a rotation of sponsored ads (which is why this tablet is so cheap!). If this bothers you, you can remove the ads for $15 on Amazon. The screen/camera resolution and speaker output isn't anything to write home about but it is absolutely great for the price! The glare while using the tablet can also be bothersome, but I purchased an anti-glare screen protector to resolve that issue.

I haven't spent enough time on it to get what I need as efficiently as I can on my Samsung Galaxy tab 10.1, but my husband prefers it to his Galaxy tab 8 (currently in use by our 10-yr-old son). Remotes are too complicated sometimes... our family joke anyway... but he'll sit down and browse the Amazon content, get all the car stuff he enjoys reading, and I haven't heard a complaint or call for help. I haven't even heard any annoyed-caveman sounds! I like that the input for the charger is at the top of the tablet. May sound trivial, but my main complaint with both Galaxy tabs is that the inputs are on the bottom, so they can't sit upright for use while being charged (bottom-portrait for the tab 8 and bottom-landscape for the tab 10.1 - either way, it hinders function). Functionality during charging isn't disturbed with the Fire tablet. When I'm ready for a new tablet, I'll probably get the Galaxy Pro because it seems friendlier for bloggers, writers, etc. but the Kindle works if you're not looking for something too complicated.

I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more",kindle keyboard light cover new kindle light cover briefly compare list pro con coverin comparisonthe kindle keyboard cover much heavier new kindle cover new case much well job secure kindle well longer hinge one edge instead form fit inside rigid rubber shell attache back new kindlethe light case old case lit screen top right corner new case light screen top middlei feel like old light mechanism durable light bar cover make stiff thin plastic instead thick rubbery plastic contain light old cover also hinge open instead pull case hinge feel subparthe light new case less angle tends get eye reading old kindle keyboard case didall still like new case fit new kindle well increase size weight much leather somewhat thin horribly look sleek kindle keep caseproscompact case look sleektight secure fituses kindles battery additional power neededprovides adequate light across entire screenconslightbar hinge seem cheapsince receive today can not yet evaluate additional drain case place kindles batteryread,4.0

28633,"As a standalone charger, this one does pretty good and I like the versatility to charge other items with the USB female plug vs. something hardwired that allows me to charge other USB-type devices in addition to something that uses a micro USB port.Charging time is faster for a Kindle Fire vs. my regular e-Ink Kindle charger, but since I haven't - and rarely - fully drain one of my Fires I cannot comment on the faster aspect for charging a Fire: I just know it works, and it does seem to charge my phone faster than the plug that came from Verizon. Thats not a shocker as this one is 9 watts vs. 5 for the normal charger.This is a replacement model to the original 9W PowerFast charger. Rather than the prior models square look this one is longer in a rectangular form and sticks out further from the socket. That seems to add more clutter to a wall socket. This years model also has rigid prongs (what you stick into the electrical socket) vs. the fold-down version of the prior model that gives it a lower profile. I didnt think too much of it at first, but the longer profile of the rectangular design, in addition to the electrical prongs not folding down into the charger, means it takes up a little bit more room in my laptop bag. Thats not good for me as now it wont fit in a side pocket for my brand of laptop bag and goes into the general pile of stuff that floats around in the main bag.19.99 seems to be a lot for an adapter of this power size, and it is: despite my comments on the changes above, the PowerFast chargers Amazon makes do seem to last.

18622,"This product has been so thoroughly reviewed that I won't repeat the obvious in any detail. It's great for reading under all conditions -- sharp typefaces and, of course, illuminated. Two small issues: 1. in dim light conditions the light at the bottom of the screen is a bit uneven. There are slightly darker areas just above each of the four lights that illuminate the screen. This does not bother me and it isn't noticeable in a brightly lit environment. More annoying is the fact that the Search function doesn't work with some books: for those, searching brings up no results, no matter what I enter. I have the same books on my Kindle Keyboard and have to use that to find what I'm looking for. I haven't contacted Amazon about this, but it seems odd. On other books, it works as expected. One other thing to keep in mind if you have an older Kindle is that it will need to be recharged more frequently, given that it's illuminated. Overall, I like this reader as the display is excellent, it's easy to hold, and page-turn and other navigation features all work well. If it weren't for the problem with searching, I'd give it five stars.",product thoroughly review wont repeat obvious detail great reading condition sharp typeface course illuminate two small issue 1 dim light condition light bottom screen bit uneven slightly darker area four light illuminate screen bother isnt noticeable brightly lit environment annoy fact search function doesnt work book search brings result matter enter book kindle keyboard use find im look havent contact amazon seem odd book work expect one thing keep mind old kindle need recharge frequently give illuminate overall like reader display excellent easy hold pageturn navigation feature work well werent problem search id give five star,4.0

17671,"I read as many reviews as I could find before buying this newest Paperwhite and what struck me the most was the contrast of the bright screen versus the print. However, when I got mine, I had to put the brightness level to 19 (out of 25) to get it to a comfortable setting. Doing that makes my battery run down before I've even read two books, and that is with the airplane setting on, meaning the WIFI is off. Luckily, I bought a charger so I can charge my Paperwhite while on trips ( without my computer, in a regular outlet) or at night when I'm finished reading. Now for the positives. I love the light weight of this Kindle even with the preferred cover that shuts it into sleep mode when closed. I absolutely LOVE the dictionary feature, because it is so easy to use and it saves the words I don't know, for study. After I've learned a word's meaning, I can delete it from the list. I got the Paperwhite with the ads, because it is nice getting suggestions of books I might enjoy that I might not see otherwise. And books are easy to order from the Kindle Store and to download through this devise. I like the cover, because it protects the screen from scratches while stored in my purse and I also purchased a stylus to keep fingerprints off the screen and I like that.

The Kindle Fire has allowed me to finally get to these books, while I'm working out, or driving.Good points:It reads aloud very well, with several fairly natural sounding voices.Amazon can convert most PDFs into a readable format, and you can change the speed.

The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet.

21952,"I really enjoy the Echo. I got an Echo Dot and liked it so much I then got the full size Echo. I originally go the Echo Dot for the novelty thinking I wouldn't really use it very much but it turns out that I use them all the time. It is not something that anyone really needs but it is handy and a lot of fun. Some of the things it does really well: It's great at voice recognition - you seldom have to repeat yourself. Setting timers, reminders, and alarms is as easy as saying Alexa, wake me at 7 am Or Alexa, tell me when 10 minutes is up. If you are a Prime member the Echo is great at playing music from your music library or from Prime music. It's also great at playing radio stations (using tune-in and other apps). In the morning I'll say Alexa, play 680 WRKO to listen to Kim and VB on the radio. Some of the things the Echo is bad at: It's well known that it uses Microsoft's Bing search engine so most anything the Echo has to search for comes back with the response I don't know that. Being able to tell the Echo to use Yahoo or Google would make this a five star rating. Also, if you set an alarm or reminder it only reminds you on the device you specify or the one that hears you. For example, if I'm in the upstairs bedroom (location of the Echo Dot) and say Remind me to call John Smith in 10 minutes and then I go downstairs to the kitchen (location of the Echo), the reminder will only be in the bedroom. It would be nice if I could have an alarm or reminder set on both devices. The Echo Dot has the same capability as the full size Echo as far as I can tell. The only difference is the full size Echo has much better sound for music. That being said, the Echo Dot still sounds great, amazing really, for such a small device. But the full size Echo is like listening to a stereo. Again, these are well-made devices and are a lot of fun and very useful. Maybe not a necessity but they sure are a fun conversation piece with guests or grandkids come around.",really enjoy echo get echo dot like much get full size echo originally go echo dot novelty think wouldnt really use much turn use time something anyone really need handy lot fun thing really well great voice recognition seldom repeat set timer reminder alarm easy say alexa wake 7 alexa tell 10 minute prime member echo great play music music library prime music also great play radio station use tunein apps morning ill say alexa play 680 wrko listen kim vb radio thing echo bad well know us microsofts bing search engine anything echo search come back response dont know able tell echo use yahoo google would make five star rating also set alarm reminder reminds device specify one hears example im upstairs bedroom location echo dot say remind call john smith 10 minute go downstairs kitchen location echo reminder bedroom would nice could alarm reminder set device echo dot capability full size echo far tell difference full size echo much well sound music say echo dot still sound great amaze really small device full size echo like listen stereo wellmade device lot fun useful maybe necessity sure fun conversation piece guest grandkids come around,4.0

This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more.

The device looks good and the LED light on top that turns on when you speak to it is great. Sound is good for music. However, I did not feel that it was a good assistant.

Was about to pack it up and return it until I called Amazon tech support. Turns out it's a known-issue that the FireTV has difficulty with 5GHz networks that are set to auto channel selection and are utilizing channel numbers above 100.The tech support person said I should change the channel to 36, 44, or 48 instead of automatic, and, it worked.Bluetooth audio and video are out of sync with Showtime, Netflix, Sling, Plex and Hulu. It's fine through speakers, but video lags slightly behind the audio using Bluetooth. Audio and video are in perfect sync with Bluetooth and Amazon Prime Video which makes me think it'll be fixed at some point, as Amazon provided video demonstrates it can work well in that regard.Gotta say I prefer the platform agnostic UI of Roku, with Amazon-world tucked away in an app. The FireTV navigation pane represents mostly Amazon products with no option to modify it. Roku's UI is more about the media, less about the provider.

So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports.

User is stuck in a do-loop with no response.2) access to quick 1-sentence read from Wikipedia is appreciated, but if you ask 'tell me more,' Alexa's voice is so rushed and computerized, some of the information is unintelligible.3) tons of skills, but so many of them are at a micro level and others are 1-time gimmicks. If you are not careful, you then need a skill to help you with all the skills you've installed.4) responses on some of the more interesting skills are just plain wrong. Vocabulary on word master is limited, so you will told your response is not a word that begins with ""X"" and we have had instances where our correct response on Jeopardy is reported as not correct. In one skill about a magic door (?) a clue is described, but when selected, you are sent backward a step with the same clue offered again. Frustrating and makes you feel you are doing something wrong or not speaking clearly. Children can get frustrated quickly.5) access to music is quirky.

The hinge that attaches to the kindle will eventually put pressure on the kindle front plastic cover and soon you will see it crack. To avoid this, you have to make sure the kindle doesn't rock back and forth from off the back cover causing the hinge to bend more and crack the front plastic further. This is hard to do if you open and close your kindle many times a day or simply lend it to someone else who doesn't know better.

727,"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8.

Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source.

My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions.

1399,"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format.

After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look.

19575,"An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.",okay reader reading ipad mini well condition except outside sunlight plus ipad play game web search etc kindle library function nearly good kindle app ipad see many book page scroll quickly versus slow swipe function kindle also like page turn kindle versus apple every page turn kindle like slow motion every fifth page refreshes entirely actually go top next page slowly order wait kindle slow page turn even reading outdoors feature kindle great reviewer indicate still sun glare page deal although least read outdoors kindle also suffers shadow along bottom screen explanation actually shadow light shin upward night time reading draw conclusion whether good engineering bad device saw others kindle serf purpose reading beach worry accidently get damage would never take ipad beach kindle almost disposable contrast maybe 3 star bit generous good supplement ipad apple ever make device use outside without glare dont see market kindle point sorry kindle decide buy reading beach price point really worth still read paper book remember still work perfectly beach reading,3.0
